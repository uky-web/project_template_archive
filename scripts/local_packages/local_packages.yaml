# package:      The namespace and name of the composer package you want to add
# git:          The URL of the git repo of the package
# branch:       The branch to check out
# composername: The name of the package for composer. For branch-like names composer
#               looks for a 'dev-' prefix ( e.g. 'dev-main') For tag/version-like  
#               names, composer looks for a '-dev' suffix (e.g.'2.0.x-dev').
#               See https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/versions.md#branches           
# version:      The version composer should alias this version as (helpful for resolving indirect dependencies)
